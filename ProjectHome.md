### History/Utilization ###

---

The MyJSQLView application is the result of a condensed version of a larger
project that was needed to allow users access to an inventory database. The
project from its inception has been and will continue to be a tool that allows
users access to database data. An effort has been made to try and make the user
interface as simple as possible to understand and use.

The tool is ideal for small businesses, scientific communities, government
entities, or educations institutions that wish access to database data with
a free open source application.

The project has chosen Google Code as its main repository for maintaining
development aspects of the project because of its commitment to open source.
