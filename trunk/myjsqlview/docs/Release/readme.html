		<p><u><b>What is MyJSQLView?</b></u></p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based interface for viewing,
			adding, editing, or deleting entries in the HSQL, MSAccess, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL,
			and SQLite databases. All tables and fields are available for access in
			the selected database.<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MyJSQLView is the result of a condensed version of a larger project
			that was needed to access an inventory database. The project from its
			inception was to be constructed from code that could be run on most
			OS, Operating Systems, platform independent. In addition the selected
			database, MySQL, was also deemed to be chosen because of its open source
			nature. The final key was network enabled. The application would need to
			be able to connect to the database either locally, same machine, or a
			server anywhere that was Internet accessable. Java and MySQL fit these
			needs.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MyJSQLView has expanded beyond the scope of MySQL and now supports
			alternate databases and plugins. The application only needs two other
			pieces of code, the JRE, Java Runtime Environment, and a JDBC, Java Database
			Connectivity, driver. The JDBC provides the driver interface between the
			Java SQL, structured query language, statements, and the database. As of
			the release of this version of MyJSQLView the application has been tested
			with the HSQL, MSAccess, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQLite databases. The
			application once installed can provide a much quicker access/update to
			a database than a web based interface frontend and MyJSQLView supports
			transaction locking. If your small business, scientific community, government
			agency, or educational institute wants to quickly access either a HSQL, MSAccess,
			MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQLite database for viewing, adding, editing,
			searching, and analyzing data MyJSQLView provides an alternative that is simple
			and easy to use.<br><br>

		<u><b>Installation Notes:<br></b></u>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MyJSQLView is a stand alone application. To get started
			download and unzip the release file to your local hard drive using a program
			such as WinZip, 7-Zip, Tar or similar compression/decompression program.
			Extract the MyJSQLView files to the desired location on the hard disk. On a
			Windows system this may be any location, but on a Unix or Linux system it will
			be in the home directory of the user. If multiple users are to access
			the application then consult with the system administrator of your
			workstation. The likely location will be in the /usr/local or a public
			directory, which all users have access to for application execution.<br><br>
		</p>
		<u><b>Update Notes:<br></b></u>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MyJSQLView updates need no special attention. Just install the latest
			release into your existing directory. For prior releases to <b>Version 3.31</b>
			though the project is recommending to perform a clean install. This is not a
			necessity, but will clean out some unused files, mainly in the images directory.
			The only other major concern of a new release that might be of interest is
			obtaining new connection parameters. Each new release that supports an
			additional database, release <b>v3.33</b> does not, will have an example configuration
			for the connection parameters in the advanced login parameters. Likely changes will be
			included in the reference myjsqlview.xml file located in the installation
			directory. Often the Driver, Protocol, SubProtocol, and Port parameters
			will be different for the various database servers. To gain access to any
			new connection parameters one may just open the reference myjsqlview.xml
			file and copy and paste any additional entries desired into your own working
			copy of the myjsqlview.xml file. See the General Setup Instructions below
			for locating this file. <font color="#ff0000">NOTICE! AS OF MyJSQLView</font>
			<b>v3.17</b> <font color="#ff0000">RELEASE A MINOR CHANGE IN THE myjsqlview.xml
			CONFIGURATION FILE WILL INVALIDATE ALL PREVIOUSLY VERSIONS' SAVED PASSWORDS.</font>
			To remedy this discrepancy use the Connection Manager to Update your sites by
			typing in the password again.<br><br>
			
		</p>
		<p><font size="+1"><strong>General Setup Instructions</strong></font><br></p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MyJSQLView application is a Java based program and
			does require the JRE, to be installed. The minimum runtime environment needs
			to be JRE-1.5. In addition to the JRE an extension, JDBC, needs to be installed
			that allows Java to communicate to the HSQL, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQLite
			database. The programs are available on the Internet free of charge. Check with
			the sites
			<a href="http://dev.mysql.com" target="_blank">dev.mysql.com</a>,
			<a href="http://oracle.com" target="_blank">oracle.com</a>,
			<a href="http://jdbc.postgresql.org" target="_blank">jdbc.postgresql.org</a>, and
			<a href="http://www.xerial.org/trac/Xerial" target="_blank">www.xerial.org</a>. The
			jar file for these extensions needs to be installed to the JRE /lib/ext directory.
			On a Windows system this JRE directory in normally under C:/Windows/java. On a
			Linux/Unix system the directory is normally under the /usr/lib directory, and is most
			easily found by typing the command "which java" in a console. Please consult with
			each vendor for specific installation instructions for these JDBC pieces of code.
			Similarly if other databases are to be accessed via the application then again
			installed the recommended  driver(s) to the Java Runtime /lib/ext directory. The
                        exception JDBC installation is for the HSQL database which uses an integrated JDBC
			built into the application. MyJSQLView as of v3.33 includes this database so no
			additional installation need take place.<br><br>
			
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new login interface and Connection Manager use
			a XML configuration file for saving user preferences. Upon first running
			MyJSQLView a reference XML file, myjsqlview.xml, located in the installation
			directory is read then copied to the users home directory under a newly created
			directory, .myjsqlview. <b>DO NOT MODIFY THIS REFERENCE FILE!</b> The newly
			created directory On Windows &reg; 98 will be 'C:Windows\.myjsqlview'. On
			Windows &reg; XP, Vista, and Windows 7 the new directory will be in the user's
			home folder. On a Linux system the new directory will be '/home/user/.myjsqview'.
			All saved changes performed in site management will be stored in the XML file located
			in the above referenced directory. The user is encouraged to make a backup of this
			file occasionally. As of MyJSQLView Version 3.17 the application also supports
			internationalization. The .myjsqlview directory in addition to retaining the XML
			configuration file will also house the file myjsqlview_locale.txt which holds
			the entry that allows control of language support.<br><br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MyJSQLView requires a database to be setup to communicate with
			in order to work. It is beyond the scope of this document for installing and setting
			up a database, but remember you must have user rights to the database tables
			you are trying to access. Please consult with your database system administrator
			for proper grant rights. If you would like to try the application and do not have
			access to a database the Dandy Made Productions web site has a MySQL database with
			some sample data in several tables that may be connected too. Visit the MyJSQLView
			project area at the site to obtain additional information about connecting via
			MyJSQLView to these sample database tables.<br>
		</p>
		<p> <strong><font size="+1">Adding a Shortcut</font></strong><br></p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add a MyJSQLView icon to your desktop, right click the mouse pointer on an unused
			area of your desktop to display the pop up menu and select <strong>New&nbsp;|&nbsp;Shortcut</strong>. Choose
			<strong>Browse</strong>, find and double click on MyJSQLView.jar, then click on <strong>Next</strong>.
			Type in "MyJSQLView" for the name of the shortcut, then click <strong>Finish</strong>. To run
			MyJSQLView, either double click on the new MyJSQLView icon or use the <strong>Start&nbsp;|&nbsp;Run</strong>
			command.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a Unix or Linux system a shortcut may be created in the KDE Desktop environment
			by right clicking on the desktop and selecting <strong>Create New | File | Link to Application.</strong>
			Give the application a name such as "MyJSQLView" in the General tab. Next select the Application tab
			and fill in the description desired then browse to the location on the disk where MyJSQLView was installed
			and select the MyJSQLView.jar file for the Command entry. The Command entry is still not complete and must
			contain the Java command. Place before the quoted MyJSQLView.jar entry, "java -jar ". Do not place quotes
			of any kind around this command, the quotes only contain the Jar file location. Example: java -jar 
			'/home/~user/MyJSQLView/MyJSQLView.jar'. Finally select the Work Path as the directory where installation
			took place.<br><br>
			
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MyJSQLView application may also be run directly from a command/console window by typing in the command
			"java -jar MyJSQLView.jar" while in the installation directory. A Linux/Unix environment will require the
			file location to be specified by "./MyJSQLView.jar", remember this must be done with a console that is running
			within a X Window environment like KDE or Gnome.
