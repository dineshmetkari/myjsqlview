During the development on MyJSQLView Version 2.72++
database export task a bug was discovered. The bug
involves the export of SQL table data. A table which
is empty will result in the insertion of a SQL command
in the exported file for values that do not exist. A
fix can be achieved by the deletion of the offending
line in the exported file. During import either with
MyJSQLView or the MySQL console the offended line will
be reported.

A fix for this problem has already been implemented in
Version 2.72++ of MyJSQLView.
