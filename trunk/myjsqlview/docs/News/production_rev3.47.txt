MyJSQLView Version 3.47 Released

The MyJSQLView project is pleased to release v3.47 to the public. The
release marks the support for the H2 database and its inclusion has a
library with the application. H2 provides an additional focal point
for allowing locale file and in-memory data analysis for MyJSQLView 
and its plugins. Architectural changes for MyJSQLView have also been
implemented with v3.47 that ease the ability to create alternate
database connections within the application. The Heat Mapper plugin
has also been updated to allow CSV imports for analysis.

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user interface frontend for
viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in several mainstream
databases. A query frame allows the building of complex SQL statements
and a SQL Query Bucket for saving such. The application allows easy
sorting, searching, and import/export of table data. A plug-in framework
has allowed the inclusion of tools to visually build queries, profile and
plot data for analysis.
