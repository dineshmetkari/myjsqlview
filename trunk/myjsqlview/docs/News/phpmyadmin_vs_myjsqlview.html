											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday night I was up reviewing the project's
											statistics and was really scratching my head over the indicators. The
											site's web page had already at my 12:30 am time zone reached some
											1000 hits. The downloads were 2! Well after every new release you
											get a little more activity, but no downloads? I thought it odd and
											eventually just went to bed, kind of wondering what the heck was going
											on. The next day my work schedule prevented my pursuing the review
											and really thinking much about it. Well by tonight I started browsing
											around and I think I found the answer. Seems a blogger posted the headline
											that I placed on the front page. Please let me dispell the misnomer.<br><br>

											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First I would like to say MyJSQLView is not the versatile
											admin. tool that phpMyAdmin is. MyJSQLView does provide a very easy and quick
											interface to do basic adds, edits, deletes, and viewing of data. The app. also
											allows easy sort, search, and a basic query tool. A quick example. Last week I
											really screwed up my web page database and could not login. I had to use the
											host's phpMyAdmin program to try and fix things. Unfortunately the web based php
											scripting and my slow connection made an easy task take for ever. So what
											did I do, I exported the table to my local machine, imported to MyJSQLView,
											edited, then exported and reloaded the table back through phpMyAdmin.
											Things went much quicker and I was able to do in five minutes what might
											have taken 15-30 minutes. This is exactly the kind of thing I created MyJSQLView
											to do. A simple user's tool for manipulating a single database. As a developer
											I needed a simple tool to manipulate a database that I was dealing with in a
											program. The program often would need debugging and I needed to change or fix
											a table field or some other aspect of the database table. The MySQL console
											allowed me to do these things quickly, but have you ever tried to view a blast
											of output that would sometimes result for a console query/update output?
											phpMyAdmin also allowed me to do these things, but I just thought it needed
											to many clicks to do what I wanted and also I do not know about you, but I'm
											just tired of waiting for php and asp web scripts to generate content in a
											web page. Maybe your lucky though and have one of those 128k+ connections and
											don't have to deal with a primitive dialup. MyJSQLView provides very little
											support for the administrative things that can be done with phpMyAdmin. Replacement
											for phpMyAdmin I think not.<br><br>
