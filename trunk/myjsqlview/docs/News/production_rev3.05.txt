MyJSQLView Version 3.05 Released

The MyJSQLView project is pleased to provide the incremental release of
Version 3.05 to the public. The release will be short lived because a
follow on version with an initial plugin feature will come out by the
end of the month. The release v3.05 fixes some minor bugs in the program
such as SQL exports having semicolons being stripped out, and Summary
Table state loading/restore of the sort order. Several new features have
been added to the program, Delete All Table Rows, Summary Table CSV
Pasting from a spreadsheet, and an Update Multiple Table Rows mechanism.
Generally the project is still on track to have a plugin architecture
implemented for future enhancements.

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based interface for viewing,
adding, editing, or deleting entries in the HSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and
PostgreSQL databases. A query frame allows the building of complex
SELECT SQL statements. The application allows easy sorting, searching,
and import/export of table data.
