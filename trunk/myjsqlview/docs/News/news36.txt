MyJSQLView Schema With PostgreSQL & HSQL

Most databases use schema to fully qualify table names
in the database. MyJSQLView does not use a fully qualified
table name in any of its SQL statements. It relies on the
database server to qualify the table name through parameters
set in the database server configuration. In PostgreSQL
this is done via the search_path and with HSQL just the
schema setting. Both of these settings can be done at the
server or at runtime through the connection.

If the database that MyJSQLView is attempting to connect to
does not have the correct schema settings then tables may fail
to load. A development release has been posted that will allow
a user to select the schema to be set at runtime if a table
that is being loaded is not defined by the default schema with
PostgreSQL and HSQL. This issue with schema is not present with
MySQL database connections with MyJSQLView. The next release of
MyJSQLView will address this issue more fully.
