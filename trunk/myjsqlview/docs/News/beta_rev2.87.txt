MyJSQLView Version 2.87 Released

The MyJSQLView Beta release has been update to Version 2.87.
The release is an incremental version that corrects the
application's deficiencies with qualifying table names in the
PostgreSQL and HSQL databases. MyJSQLView will now recognize
and use the full schema.table name with all transactions.
There is no need to have the correct search path set in order
for access to non-system tables and views. 

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user interface
frontend for viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in
the MySQL, PostgreSQL, and HSQL databases. A query frame allows
the building of complex SELECT SQL statements. The application
allows easy sorting, searching, and import/export of table
data.
