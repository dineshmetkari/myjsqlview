MyJSQLView Login Interface

The MyJSQLView project would like to inform the
public of its work to improve the MyJSQLView
login interface to allow the loading and saving
of connection parameters. The MyJSQLView project
feels this is an important step in making the
application more user friendly. The new login
interface will also allow the moving of the
application to the possible next step of accessing
databases beyond MySQL. So please bookmark us
and check with us again in the future for the
next realease.

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user
interface frontend for viewing, editing, or deleting
entries in a MySQL database. A basic query frame
allows the building of complex SQL statements.
Sorting searching, and export of all table data
easily.
