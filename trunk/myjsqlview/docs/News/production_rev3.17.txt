MyJSQLView Version 3.17 Released

The MyJSQLView project is pleased to provide the release of
Version  3.17 to the public. The release marks the cumulative
effort of many years now to complete an easy to use framework
for database access, and versatility through a plugin environment.
Several enhancements have been implemented in this release
to improve network performance and proper searches in the
database with regard to date fields. Included in the v3.17
release too is Internationalization, i18n.

The exciting highlight in this release in my opinion as the
Project Manager is the modular plugin framework. One can now
create an independent piece of Java code that MyJSQLView will
load dynamically at runtime. The first test case for this
modularity came in the last release, v3.06, with the Table
Field Profiler tab. That plotting routine now is a plugin that
is loaded at runtime. Though the group would have wished to
include other plugins at this time that are being worked on
they were just not stable enough for production. In the coming
weeks documenation will be released to the web site to outline
how to create plugins for MyJSQLView.

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user interface
frontend for viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in
the HSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL databases. A query
frame allows the building of complex SELECT SQL statements.
The application allows easy sorting, searching, and import/export
of table data.
