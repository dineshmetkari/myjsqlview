MyJSQLView Version 2.64 Released

The MyJSQLView Beta release has been updated to
Version 2.64. The release highlights the new
login access features. The user is now allowed
to stipulate the connection parameters to the
selected database. A Connection Manager has also
been created for the managing and saving site
connections.

The project is looking for individuals that have
access to DB2, Oracle, or MSSQL databases to try
MyJSQLView with. Any feedback on the functionality
of the tool for use with these databases would be
greatly appreciated. Contact the project manager
for help if need be, in the setup of the Driver,
and advanced parameters settings.
