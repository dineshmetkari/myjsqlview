MyJSQLView Incremental Release

The MyJSQLView project will release an incremental version
within the next week to address the schema issue with
PostgreSQL and HSQL databases. A development version,
2.8610, has been posted to the download section to temporary
address the selection of fully qualified tables with schema.
Most users that use the default PUBLIC schema will not be
effected by this issue with table names. The access to MySQL
databases with the MyJSQLView application do not incur any
problems in this area.

The release next week will correct the deficiency in the
MyJSQLView application architecture and allow users to
access all non-system tables and views associated with a
database that the user has rights to.
