MyJSQLView Bugs in Revision 2.61

The MyJSQLView project would like to notify the
public of serious problems in the applications
ability to properly update and add entries to
a MySQL database. Because of these problems in
the application, users should only use the
basic functionality of the code to view, delete,
sort, and search database tables entries. The
query frame in the application should be stable.
The project manager thanks the public for shaking
out these bugs in the current beta version.

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user
interface frontend for viewing,  & deleting entries
in a MySQL database. A basic query frame allows the
building of complex SQL statements.
