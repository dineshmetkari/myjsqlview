MyJSQLView 2.81++ Development

The MyJSQLView team is continuing to implement Phase II of
the project by supporting additional databases. As of this
news release the project has successfully added HSQLDB to
the list. Currently the basic data interface is functioning
correctly with the ability to view, add, edit, delete, and
import SQL dumps. A complete review is taking place in the
process of adding HSQLDB to insure an easily modular architecture
is in place to successfully implement Phase II of the project.
HSQLDB was functional within a few hours, with the majority
of that time spent reviewing documentation, so version 2.81
work has come to fruition. The next release 2.81++ will work
to fully support the HSLQDB and try to support all data types,
to include arrays. A update feature for CSV imports will also
be implemented.

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user interface
frontend for viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in
the MySQL & PostgreSQL databases. A query frame allows the
building of complex SELECT SQL statements. The application
allows easy sorting, searching, and import/export of table
data.
