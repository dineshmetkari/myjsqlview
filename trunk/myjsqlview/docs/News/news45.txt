MyJSQLView 3.01++ Development

The MyJSQLView project would liked to have had an update to the
application this April, but a few side projects have distracted me
as the project manager from properly pushing the development
forward. On a positive note the production release, v3.01, seems
to be solid because no major bugs have been reported or discovered.
Currently the tasks list for the next release has been fixed and
amounts to mainly solidifying the core architecture for the plugin
framework. There will be a few added features such as a search
and replace and the ability to allow the control of date formats
in the CSV, comma separated values, imports/exports. A translation
framework is also on the list of items to be accomplished, but might
be sacrificed to get the next release out the door. As a side note
that translation will probably be in the running two month 2nd place
download leader of the country of Germany.

One final piece of information for those that might have noticed.
The MyJSQLView project will no longer be actively supported at the
Sourceforge site. The Sourceforge site's leadership in this developer's
opinion has deviated to a purely business model that is far removed
from its origin concept of a software source forge for developers. I
understand the need to generate revenue, but the new site owners look
like they are only interested in traffic and creating another social
networking site. One of their main sponsors Microsoft and an appointee
to their board of the same bodes no good will toward open source. So
all current news, documentation, and downloads will only be available
with the Dandy Made Productions web site.
