MyJSQLView Version 2.72++ Development Begins

The MyJSQLView Version 2.72++ development has now begun in
earnest. One of the first tasks to be completed has been the
ability to FLUSH PRIVILEGES when logged as the root user for
the mysql database. The application's primary purpose to
view, add, and edit database table entries necessitated
this feature. After all what use is editing an entry for
managing users if it will not take effect unless a flush
of the cache takes place?

Over the last several months the MyJSQLView application's
future direction has been weighed heavily. It has pretty
much at this time been determined it will not become a tool
for managing a database. Rather focus is going to continue
in the direction of accessing, processing, and analyzing,
database table entries. A list of the current identified tasks
to be completed for the next release is accessable via the
project's development home with sourceforge.net
