MyJSQLView Version 3.01 Released

The MyJSQLView project has moved to production with the
release of Version 3.01. The release marks major modifications
in the GUI, graphical user interface, and the implementation
of a framework that will provide a basis for a library of
plugins in the future. It was decided by the team to release
Version 3.01 at this time instead of later in April with
MyJSQLView's first plugin so that the user may have access
to the new interface. 

With the release of MyJSQLView version 3.01 the project has
embarked on Phase III of development. The first two phases
of development involved the creation of a simple and easy to
use interface that supported several common databases in the
market. During Phase III the project will endeavor to provide
tools that will allow users to view and analyze data in a
mired of ways. In terms of today's techno-talk, BI, business
intelligence.
