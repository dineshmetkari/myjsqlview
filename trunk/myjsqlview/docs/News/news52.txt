MyJSQLView Development & Google Code

The MyJSQLView next release development is close to three quarters complete and the
expected availability will be either at the end of this month or early May. Currently
there has been lots of refinements in the program's features and some performance
enhancements. The code has also gone through some major cleanup and consolidation
that will help future database support additions. Presently the project has SQLite,
MongoDB, Firebird, MonetDB, and HBase databases targeted for review. The latter is
of particular interest because of the frenzy in the tech world for the cloud. Though
the next release will not support any additional databases this development cycle 
will greatly enhance the ability to add support for future additions. 

The project would like to also at this time announce the choice of Google Code as the
central location for all development activity. Developers and users alike may find a
forum there where issues may be addressed directly and the latest SVN repository for
the code. It was found that Google Code provided a much cleaner and efficient interface
for managing the development aspects of the project than Sourceforge. Several Google
Groups have been setup to allow monitoring & contributing to input for the MyJSQLView
project. Links have been provided below that can direct individuals to these areas on
the web with Google.
