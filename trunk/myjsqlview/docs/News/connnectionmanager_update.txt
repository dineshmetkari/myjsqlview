MyJSQLView Connection Manager Status Update

   The ConnectionManager for MyJSQLView has been delayed
for a couple more weeks. The basic functionality is present,
but needs additional work. The next release this month
will incorporate the Connection Manager site management
dialog. Parameters for connection selection will be directly
accessible to the user for control and saving. Some additional
features for SQL import/export will also be implemented in
the next release. The next version of MyJSQLView will
open the door for those wishing to access database other
than MySQL.
