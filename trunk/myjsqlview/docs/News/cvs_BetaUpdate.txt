   MyJSQLView Current Beta State

   MyJSQLView is pleased to announce the availability
of the current state of the application source via CVS.
CVS has been update and will now be maintained so users
and developers may obtain and review the current state
of the code. MyJSQLView does this to comply with its
open source nature and to allow users to inspect the
program to insure quality.

   MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user
interface frontend for viewing, editing, or deleting
entries in a MySQL database. A basic query frame allows
the building of complex SQL statements.
