MyJSQLView Version 3.03++ Development

The MyJSQLView project development has been proceeding steadily for the past
few months and will release the next version in early November. The coding up
to this point has mainly focused on inconsistencies in the program's behavior,
a couple of new features and some minor bug fixes. One of those bugs involves
the import of SQL statement content that has semicolons stripped out. A more
trouble some issue has been reported on the program's functionality with MS
Vista that has not been completely addressed. The project would like to also
have some testing done with the new MS Windows 7, so if you do try MyJSQLView
with that OS and problems occur please contact us. Development on the next
release has mainly been oriented on tidying up the program and organizing the
architecture so that less work will be involved in the coding for the translation
and plugin environments. Since much of this work is almost complete it has
been decided to go ahead and release 3.03++ as an incremental version prior
to an update with the code for translations and the plugins. Much more work still
needs to be done to complete the plugin environment and identify a suitable
feature for implementation, so no sense in delaying to the public updates as
they arise.

The project would also like to gracious thank the Montana State University,
College of Business for selection in participation with students in the MGMT475R,
Management Practicum Course.
