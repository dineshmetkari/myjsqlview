MyJSQLView Version 3.48 Released

The MyJSQLView project is pleased to release v3.48 to the public. The
release marks support for the Microsoft SQL database. The inclusion of
the MS SQL database nearly completes the application's ability to access
all the major relational database products. The Visual QueryBuilder plugin
has also been updated in this release to bring it into alignment with
the common core parser syntax code of its basis.

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user interface frontend for
viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in several mainstream
databases. A query frame allows the building of complex SQL statements
and a SQL Query Bucket for saving such. The application allows easy
sorting, searching, and import/export of table data. A plug-in framework
has allowed the inclusion of tools to visually build queries, profile and
plot data for analysis.
