MyJSQLView Version 3.29 Released

The MyJSQLView project is pleased to provide the release of Version
3.29 to the public. The release provides two additional features
for the application with regard to table state history and a query
bucket. The table state history provides a standard mechanism just
like a web browser where sort/searches for table data is accessible
for previous/next states relative to a queue position. The query
bucket allows table states to be saved into a handy frame that can
be used in a drag and drop method to set SQL statements into alternate
receptive applications and MyJSQLView's own plugins.

Plugins are going to become a major feature for MyJSQLView in the
future. With that said the Table Field Profiler that is included
with the application has been updated and modified to take advantage
of the new Query Bucket asset of MyJSQLView. Documentation is available
both at the project's website and with the MyJSQLView download to
help developers in creating their own plugins for the application.

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user interface
frontend for viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in
the HSQL, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQLite databases. A
query frame allows the building of complex SELECT SQL statements.
The application allows easy sorting, searching, and import/export
of table data.
