MyJSQLView Version 3.40 Released

The MyJSQLView project is pleased to release v3.40 to the public. The
release marks a major reorganizational effort to the source code and plugin
management. Though the public will notice little with regard to the source
subpackaging the plugin management changes bring the ability to now load plugins
from remote locations. Plugin repositories can now be created by individuals or
organizations that wish to provide custom plugins on the basis of a realtime
network loading capability. In that regard the MyJSQLView project has added to
its own public repository a free open source plugin that contains a graphical
SQL query builder.

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user interface frontend for
viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in several mainstream
databases. A query frame allows the building of complex SQL statements
and a SQL Query Bucket for saving such. The application allows easy
sorting, searching, and import/export of table data. A plug-in framework
has allowed the inclusion of tools to profile and plot data for analysis.
