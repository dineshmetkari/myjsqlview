MyJSQLView Version 2.86 Released

The MyJSQLView Beta release has been update to Version 2.86.
The release has focused on providing the ability of the
application to connect to a HSQL database. All the basic
features that MyJSQLView has provided to other databases are
now available with the HSQL database. Several minor bugs were
fixed in the release in addition to proper support for
PostgreSQL Version 8.3.0. Two new features were also added,
basic array data type support and the ability to import
delimited text files as either an insert or update.


MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user interface
frontend for viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in
the MySQL, PostgreSQL, and HSQL databases. A query frame allows
the building of complex SELECT SQL statements. The application
allows easy sorting, searching, and import/export of table
data.
