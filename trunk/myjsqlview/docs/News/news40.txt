MyJSQLView 2.87++ Development Update

The development of MyJSQLView has been under hiatus
for the last month. Sorry folks seems summer brings
lots of other outside activity that keeps drawing a
developer from the computer screen to the visible
window portal events. Not to worry, being a seasoned
planner the task schedule still reflects the expected
next release date. Should be close. The month of July
was not totally wasted to non-development. The other
open source project I maintain, NA_Worksheet, was
cleaned up and some new features were added to the
graphing capability. I guess a drifting took place
after dealing with the legacy Oracle database that
tended me back to mathematics and the Phase III
development that I would like to get to with MyJSQLView.
