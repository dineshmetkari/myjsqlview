MyJSQLView Phase II

The MyJSQLView project has now entered phase II
of development. Phase I was the basic implementation
of a simple to use interface for users to access
and manipulate database data. During phase II the
project will now focus on expanding the existing
database entry to beyond MySQL. The current work
has already begun the evaluating and redesigning
of the base core architecture to accomplish this goal.
Much of this work was done during the Version 2.64
creation of the Connection Manager. At this time
successful access and manipulation of data in a
PostgreSQL database is taking place. The next release
of MyJSQLView will have a fully generic core that
should allow creation of connections to other databases
to be easily supported within the UI. The release
will attempt to provide at least basic support for
PostgreSQL and possibly HSQLDB.

Phase I - Create a simple to use interface for 
	  manipulating data in a MySQL database.

Phase II - Expand the interface to support additional
           databases.

Phase III - Where MyJSQLView and the NA_WorkSheet
            projects begin to merge.
