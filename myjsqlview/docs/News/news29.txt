MyJSQLView Version 2.76++ Development

The development for the next release of MyJSQLView
is proceeding slowly. The core changes have been
made to allow alternate database access and the
changes seem to be working relatively fine. Over
90% of the code has needed no adjustments. The
TableEntryForm and DataDumpThread classes are
still of some concern, because of already know
multiplicity that will be needed if these classes
remain singular in nature. As indicated in the
last couple of news releases the focus on an
alternate database access has been with PostgreSQL
at this point. About a third of the documentation
for that database has been reviewed to include the
data types defined. All the standard data types have
been tested in MyJSQLView, except for the geometric
types. Some perplexity is noted on the inclusion of
these forms of 'Objects' as data types. With the
successful access/functionality also taking place in
some sample PostgreSQL databases things are looking
promising for Phase II of MyJSQLView.

On a side note all the known bugs for version 2.76 of
MyJSQLView have been corrected in the current development.
At this time a release could be generated, but since the
bugs are minor in nature and the core changes for alternate
database access have not been fully tested its probably
best to delay. Also head over to the web site's documentation
page to see a Perspective of the code for the application.
