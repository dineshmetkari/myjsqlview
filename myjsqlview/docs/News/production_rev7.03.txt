MyJSQLView Version 7.03 Released

The MyJSQLView project is pleased to release v7.03 to the public. The
release is to fix the plugin management tool proxy setting property.
Remote HTTP repositories can not be created or loaded. The release
also is for archiving purposes to finalize the last release before
the move of the code version control from Google Code to an alternative
private server.

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user interface frontend for
viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in several mainstream
databases. A query frame allows the building of complex SQL statements
and a SQL Query Bucket for saving such. The application allows easy
sorting, searching, and import/export of table data. A plug-in framework
has allowed the inclusion of tools to visually build queries, profile and
plot data for analysis.
