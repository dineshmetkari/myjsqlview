MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user interface frontend for
viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in several mainstream
databases. A query frame allows the building of complex SQL statements
and a SQL Query Bucket for saving such. The application allows easy
sorting, searching, and import/export of table data. A plug-in framework
has allowed the inclusion of tools to visually build queries, profile and
plot data for analysis.
