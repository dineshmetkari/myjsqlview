MyJSQLView Version 2.91 Released

The MyJSQLView Beta release has been update to Version 2.91.
The release highlights the implementation for support of the
Oracle database 10g. All basic aspects of the application
that had been in place for the other supported databases is
now available for 10g. As a developer and project manager I
have to said though that I have been rather disappointed with
the performance of this newly supported database. The Oracle
database appears to have a rich set of features for the
enterprise, but seems to have dragged core components as it
has evolved that are legacy in nature. In all fairness though
I'm just a novice in the configuration, and tuning of this
database and was more focused on functionality with the MyJSQLView
application than optimizing. One must also consider of course
the hardware platform used in this development process.

With the release of MyJSQLView version 2.91 the project will
end Phase II of development. A production release will be
forthcoming near the end of the year which will provide the
framework for Phase III evolution and refinement of the GUI.
Any comments regarding the application's functionality, interface,
or feature set/enhancements would be most welcome in this
coming process to production.
