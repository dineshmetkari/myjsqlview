The MyJSQLView project will continue development soon. As the admin. of the project I have
been tied with many other various projects and tasks that have underminded my attention
to the application. Last month I spoke of a tool review that took place. The project has
reviewed other database open source access tools and will use this information gathered
to enhance MyJSQLView. The list of applications reviewed was HeidiSQL, MySQLGraphic,
MySQLDump, DBEdit, SQLeonardo, SquirrelSQL, ExecuteQuery, SuperQuail, FreeQueryBuilder,
JavaMyAdmin, and PhpMyAdmin. The last of course being the predominate most popular tool
available. Beside PhpMyAdmin, ExecuteQuery turned out in my opinion to be the most polished
well put together application out there. All the tools beside PhpMyAdmin had deficiencies
in the user interface with regard to database connection. MyJSQLView I believe addresses
both this issue and also includes a very simple user interface for manipulating a database.

Today I began the process of outlining the tasks that will address further development
with MyJSQLView. The tasks have been broken down into these key areas: Improvements/Additions
to the Preferences Menu, Fixes of bugs and enhancements to the Data Import/Export, Query Frame
Improvements, and Help Menu Additions. As said last month a lot of this will be code clean
up and bug fixes, but some will further the formulation of the future for MyJSQLView. A
decision has been made to include basic database administration in a separate UI, la Query
Frame. The separation of this functionality will allow the creation later of a MyJSQLView
enterprise version aimed toward businesses where the tool may be used in a a multiuser/controlled
environment.
