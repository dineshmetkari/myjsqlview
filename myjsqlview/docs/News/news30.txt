MyJSQLView Version 2.76++ Approaching a Conclusion

The development for the next release of the MyJSQLView
application is beginning to come to a conclusion. As
of the date of this news release the major development
tasks left have to do with PostgreSQL table key testing
and table/database structure SQL data export. Of course
many other general tasks need to take place before a
release, ex. documentation. The current projected 
release is somewhere around the 7th of Jan. 2008. Looks
like that can be met, maybe possibly sooner. At this
time the major changes to the application are with 
the support for the PostgreSQL database. A CSV data
import feature has also been added. The project will
probably ask for help from those that have PostgreSQL
databases to try MyJSQLView before release. So if you
or someone you know might like to test MyJSQLView on
a PostgreSQL database please contact the project manager.
