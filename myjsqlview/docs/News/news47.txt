MyJSQLView Webpage Redesign

The MyJSQLView project's webpage has under gone a major redesign in the
last month that is sure to serve the application's needs for the future.
The old webpage design was adequate for basic information, but lacked
the ability to expand easily into new areas. The new site is all most
pure HTML/CSS beside some scripting to ease maintenance. There is no
Flash, or Javascript to slow the loading or cripple navigation for those
that browse without plugins enabled. The site has been tested with most
of the major browsers out there and seems to function decently except
for some quirks with IE. Hey what can I say if IE does not adhere to basic
standards. Included in the new site is a News mailing list that users
may stay informed about updates to the application. With this new design
extension for expansion should scale without as much effort which will
allow focus on the MyJSQLView application's needs. It might also be noted
that the MyJSQLView program is used in the maintenance of this site's
news. The program provides a convenient method to generate and update
news stories that has lessen the requirement to create HTML content.
Sure phpMyAdmin could be used, but MyJSQLView can be fired up, edit,
and update content before you even get through the login with your
browser with that tool.
