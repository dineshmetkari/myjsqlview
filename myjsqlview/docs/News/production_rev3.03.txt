MyJSQLView Version 3.03 Released

The MyJSQLView project is pleased to provide the incremental release of
Version 3.03 to the public. The release is minor in nature, but continues
to polish the application with some minor bug fixes, and performance
enhancements with regard to network bandwidth reduction. The software
resumes the march toward the goal of providing additional capabilities
besides a simple database access and update tool. Though release v3.03
does not show outwardly to the user any of these Phase III features, a
framework is being created for a plugin environment to enable expanded
enhancements. What the user will find new in v3.03 is the ability to save
and load individual summary table states and control date field formats
for CSV import/exports. If you use MyJSQLView and have questions about
the software or additional needs from the tool, let us know. Input is
always welcome about the tool's usefulness or lack thereof.
