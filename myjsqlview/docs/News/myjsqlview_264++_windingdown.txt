MyJSQLView Release 2.64++ Development Winding Down

The development for the next release of MyJSQLView is winding down.
All the major aspects identified as bugs/goals have been completed.
Some wrapping up is taking place for the Query Frame and Entry Form
add/edits. In addition to the development some administrative tasks
will now begin, documentation update and package creation being the
major tasks. So a release should be expected soon. MyJSQLView 2.64++
has focused on the user interaction with a MySQL database and its
tables' entries being viewed, added, and edited. At this time no
major additional features such as MySQL administration have been
implemented. 

As the project manager I have been a little concerned over the current
2.64 package being downloaded because of bugs in the keys as discussed
in the last news release. The thought has occurred to me to remove this
release, but I have kept it present, because I feel as though the
application may still be useful to users that wish to access database
tables with single primary keys. So please if the current download
turns out deficit for your needs check back for release 2.64++.
