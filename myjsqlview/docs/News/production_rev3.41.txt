MyJSQLView Version 3.41 Released

The MyJSQLView project is pleased to release v3.41 to the public. The
release marks seven years, 2005, since the application was first started
in a small sparse apartment in Fairview, OR USA. This current release
now includes the graphical SQL query builder, QueryBuilder, plugin as
a default in the tool. The project this year will continue to offer new
features and plugins to expand upon the tools longevity.

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user interface frontend for
viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in several mainstream
databases. A query frame allows the building of complex SQL statements
and a SQL Query Bucket for saving such. The application allows easy
sorting, searching, and import/export of table data. A plug-in framework
has allowed the inclusion of tools to visual build queries, profile and
plot data for analysis.
