MyJSQLView Version 3.30 Released

The MyJSQLView project has released a preliminary production version to
address several reported problems with the application. Since this release
is to correct these bugs a more fully vetted release will be forth coming
by the end of the month or early next.

The release Version 3.30 corrects the running of the application 
on specifically the Ubuntu Linux OS with the Gnome desktop. Because of
the type of bug that was discovered it is possible this may effect all
uses of the application on the Gnome desktop. The second issued addressed
by the release is the lack to properly export PDF Summary Table data. A
failure on the project to properly build the last release with an updated
iText library file inclusion was the cause.
