MyJSQLView Version 2.76 Data Export Bug

During the next phase of development on the
MyJSQLView application a bug was discovered 
in the Data | Export | SQL Format | Table
routine. The preferences' panel allows the
control of excluding the data from an exported
table. Seems it is broken. Data is exported,
the checkbox has no effect.

A second bug has also been discovered in the
Query Tool. If an item is selected to be viewed
on a successful query the text/blob fields
are not properly accessable. Text/blob fields
are represented as a button which normally allows
viewing of text or a save of the information.
The buttons take no action at all.

The MyJSQLView project has reached a junction
in its development and the data export bug was
discovered while coding for testing the access
to a PostgreSQL database. The access was successful,
but has problems. An exploration is now taking
place on whether alternate databases will be
fully support.
