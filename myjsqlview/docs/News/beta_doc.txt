   MyJSQLView Beta Revised to Version 2.4

   The MyJSQLView Beta release has been revised to
Version 2.4 for the purposes of documentation
inclusion/update. Hopefully the more accurate
information and application requirements will help
users to more easily use MyJSQLView.
   MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user
interface frontend for viewing, editing, or deleting
entries in a MySQL database.
