MyJSQLView Development Status

The MyJSQLView application is again under development
to push the tool forward. As indicated in prior news
releases the program is well into Phase II of its 
evolution. During Phase II the application has been
solidifying the architecture to support multiple databases
easily. Presently the team has successfully added the
Oracle database, with basic operations in place like
adding, editing, deleting table entries and import/exports
of data. The next release will try to fully support the
Oracle 10g Express Edition.

The direction for MyJSQLView will begin to transition into
Phase III of development at the beginning of the next
release. An evaluation is taking place on how much of the
next version will have coding in place to support Phase
III. During Phase III MyJSQLView will implement a plugin
type of environment for BI, business intelligence, addons.
Consideration is taking place on which type of basic BI
feature should initially be incorporated. Dashboards are
a solid contender at this point in the front of the lineup
because of their broad data architectural requirements and
functionality. As the project leader for MyJSQLView I'm
pleased to finally see development begin to move into Phase
III. Phase III of development is where I have striven to
get the tool for over two years.
