MyJSQLView Version 3.33 Released

The MyJSQLView project is pleased to release v3.33 to the public. The
release includes improvements in the efficiency of use for the SQL Query
Bucket and an Aggregation/GROUP BY feature for the Advanced Sort/Search
Form. The new release also brings a new default plugin called HeatMapper
that allows the plotting of multi-variable numeric data. Initial tests
for the HeatMapper plugin used latitude, longitude, and temperature
data from measurements in the Alantic with over 90k records. The coding
for this plugin solidified the selection of HyperSQL for in memory data
analysis.

The selection of HyperSQL for in memory data analysis voids the backward
compatibility of MyJSQLView with HSQL 1.8x. As of version 3.33 MyJSQLView
will not work with databases with that format and also may crash if the
earlier hsqldb.jar is placed in the Java class path. The HyperSQL database
and JDBC are now included as a library component of the MyJSQLView download.

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user interface frontend
for viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in the HSQL, MSAccess,
MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQLite databases. A query frame allows
the building of complex SQL statements. The application allows easy
sorting, searching, and import/export of table data.
