MyJSQLView Revamped GUI Available for Trial

The MyJSQLView project has now entered Phase III of its
development and as such will begin the implementation of
a plugin framework for extensions to the application.
The plugin framework should allow the project and others
the ability to easily add features to the tool with the
continued goal of allowing access and analysis of database
data. With that in mind the project has released a
development version that begins some of that framework
for a plugin environment which has resulted in GUI,
graphical user interface, changes. The public is welcome
and encouraged to try the new interface in the hope of
providing the team with feedback on its usability. The
development release, 2.93X, is not a stand alone package,
but rather a limited set of files that are meant to
replace or add to an existing installation. Make a backup
copy of your current MyJSQLView.jar file so that you may
revert back to a prior release as needed before installation
of the development version.
