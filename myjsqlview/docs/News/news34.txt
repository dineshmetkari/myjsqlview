MyJSQLView Bug With PostgreSQL 8.3.0

The MyJSQLView project is well into the testing phase
for the version 2.81++ release. Currently all development
work and testing as been performed with PostgreSQL 8.2.5.
Last night I was able to finally setup a spare server
with the 8.3.0 release of PostgreSQL for testing. Upon
running the MyJSQLView application it immediately crashed.
Upon tracing down the problem it was discovered a boolean
conditional expression "WHERE 1" was not properly single
quoted. The bug has been fixed and is available from the
CVS depository at SourceForge.

As indicated MyJSQLView is well into the testing phase and
is ahead of the projected schedule for the next release.
Expect an updated version of MyJSQLView at the end of next
week.
