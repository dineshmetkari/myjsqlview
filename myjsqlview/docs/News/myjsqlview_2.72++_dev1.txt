MyJSQLView Version 2.72++ Development

The MyJSQLView Version 2.72 release has been out in the
public domain for about a month now and all seems relatively
quiet. A quiet project after a release always seems to mean
a couple things to me. Either the program is not being used, not many
downloads, or it generally functions as desired and is documented
well enough so not many bugs are submitted or questions asked.

The development for MyJSQLView 2.72++ is already being planned
and tasks are starting to be identified. Generally there will
no major new features, except a database SQL export. The plan
at this time is to continue enhancing the interface and capabilities
in the add/edit form. One of those enhancements will the inclusion
of the capability of implementing functions on the table fields.
Ideally the work will continue on the basic interface until all
operations that may be performed on a table field are available.
The next version should be able to accomplish this and then
new features will be considered again.
