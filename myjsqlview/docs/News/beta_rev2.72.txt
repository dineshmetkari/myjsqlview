MyJSQLView Version 2.72 Released

The MyJSQLView Beta release has been update to Version 2.72.
The release fixed deficiencies in table key recognition and
bugs in the import/export of data. Several enhancements have
been made to the application's Table Entry Form input and
preferences settings.

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user interface
frontend for viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in
a MySQL database. A query frame allows the building of complex
SELECT SQL statements. The application allows easy sorting, 
searching, and import/export of table data.
