MyJSQLView Next Release 2.64++ Status

   The development of the next release of MyJSQLView is proceeding slowly,
and steadily. A new Preferences Menu has been completed and many code
fixes have been implemented. One of fixes that has been instigated had
to do with database keys/indexes. MyJSQLView was originally designed
for access to a specific set of controlled datebase tables. Those tables
all had single primary keys with some index fields. Of course MySQL
tables can have multiple keys/indexes which Version 2.64 of MyJSQLView
can fail to detect for edits and deletes. So please be patient with
us we are addressing the problem. Because of this problem the next
release may not have the updates to the Query Frame, but will address
all open bugs, so that a package can be released sooner. An update will
be coming soon so check back.
											
   A lot of the work for the next release has really been focused on making
the basic user interface for the application more versatile, with some
new features. The project has an open help wanted listed with SourceForge
for some creative coding, and some new ideas have surfaced which the
right programmer might wish to entertain. Please contact the project
manager if you would like to contribute to the project.
