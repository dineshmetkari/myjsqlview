MyJSQLView Version 7.02 Released

The MyJSQLView project is pleased to release v7.02 to the public. The
release is mainly oriented around bringing the application into compliance
with Java 1.7. In that vein considerable enthusiasm has been generated
in enabling the JavaFX framework for plugins. The graphic and media
enhancements in that framework has already brought work on some future
plugins to be released later this year. The v7.02 release also includes
an update for the support of the Oracle 11g database and the bundling
of a library for incorporating SQLite directly into the app.

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user interface frontend for
viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in several mainstream
databases. A query frame allows the building of complex SQL statements
and a SQL Query Bucket for saving such. The application allows easy
sorting, searching, and import/export of table data. A plug-in framework
has allowed the inclusion of tools to visually build queries, profile and
plot data for analysis.
