MyJSQLView Development Update

The last release of MyJSQLView is to a great extent silently
moved to the past. During the present development a few bugs
have been discovered. The first within a week or so after the
release of Version 2.81. That bug was never documented,
but was fixed immediately and deemed non-critical with no 
remembrance currently in mind. So if you find it perhaps you
may send the project manager some pale-mail in annoyance. Now
two other bugs have been documented with one fixed and the other
still open. The already fixed bug had to do PostgreSQL
table/database scheme structure dumps and time/timestamp fields
with precision data. During a structure dump an ending parenthesis
will be missing on the precision data fields. The still open bug,
task# 145594, has to do with CSV MySQL bit exports. The bit
pattern is exported as a integer and therefore will fail to
be properly imported back into the database via CSV imports.

Now the MyJSQLView project is pleased to announce that support
for the HSQLDB has been fully implemented in the current development,
but not fully tested. All tasks associated with the next release
have been documented at the project's home at Sourceforge. The
major goals at this time are to complete the ability of MyJSQLView
to support array data types and CSV replace/update imports. Once
these major development tasks have been completed along with
administrative tasks then a MyJSQLView update will be forthcoming.
