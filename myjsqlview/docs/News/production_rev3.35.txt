MyJSQLView Version 3.35 Released

The MyJSQLView project is pleased to release v3.35 to the public. The
release is a maintenance update to address several issues that manifest
themselves when using the SQL Query Bucket and Query Frame. Drops to the
Query Bucket from the main summary table fail to properly create the
syntax as derived from the search and sort parameters in the Summary
Table. Fixes to the Query Frame now allow the use of aliases. The
application has also been updated to remove legacy data structures
that had decrease the efficiency of the application.

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user interface frontend for
viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in the several mainstream
databases. A query frame allows the building of complex SQL statements
and a SQL Query Bucket for saving such. The application allows easy
sorting, searching, and import/export of table data. A plug-in framework
has allowed the inclusion of tools to profile and plot data for analysis.
