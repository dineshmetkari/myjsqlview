The MyJSQLView project is pleased to release v3.34 to the public. The

exports associated with database tables with 100k+ rows. Modifications
have been made to allow the control of table reads and writes by way of
a General Options Preferences. In addition the release as the prior one
makes improvements to the HeatMapper plugin. The TableFieldProfiler 
plugin has also been expanded to include a cluster analysis tool as

MyJSQLView provides an easy to use Java based user interface frontend for
viewing, adding, editing, or deleting entries in the several mainstream
databases. A query frame allows the building of complex SQL statements
and a SQL Query Bucket for saving such. The application allows easy
sorting, searching, and import/export of table data. A plug-in framework
has allowed the inclusion of tools to profile and plot data for analysis.
